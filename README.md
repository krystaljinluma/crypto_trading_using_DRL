Trading is a broad term and covers a multitude of financial markets, such as stock markets and
foreign exchange. Cryptocurrency trading - in simple terms buying and selling cryptocurrency, adds
a new dimension to currency trading regime with its dynamic force and volatility. Bitcoin as the
first digital currency to be created has an extremely volatile nature. Therefore, Bitcoin trading
brings out massive opportunity to capitalize on the risks and allows for maximum yield whenever
possible. Furthermore, because of bitcoinâ€™s decentralized nature, its price cannot undergo revaluation
by certain individuals and is less impacted by industry news, but instead as a consequence
of the market as a whole, following the laws of supply and demand, bitcoin trading is extremely
popular among traders and is one of the most respected, capitalized and traded cryptocurrency in
the world. Because of these reasons, bitcoin trading became a frequent topic explored by machine
learning researchers and industry leaders, aiming to develop generalizable and robust models.

In our project, we explored the possibility of using Deep Reinforcement Learning to train an agent to
make intelligent long-short decisions in order to maximize the profit-reward function by capitalizing
on the opportunity to buy bitcoin when the price is low and sell bitcoin when the price is high. The
following sections first discuss relevant work done by other researchers about financial trading using
deep learning and reinforcement learning, then explain our approach to implement a non deep learning
model baseline, a deep learning model baseline, and an advanced deep reinforcement learning
model. Lastly, we compare the performance for each of the models, and conduct analyses on why
the performance differs.
